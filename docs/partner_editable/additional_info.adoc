// Add steps as necessary for accessing the software, post-configuration, and testing. Donâ€™t include full usage instructions for your software, but add links to your product documentation for that information.
//Should any sections not be applicable, remove them

= Post-deployment steps
// If post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading

== Getting Started
// If post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading

Once the deployment finishes, review the CloudFormation output 

< We need put screenshots here from output >

== Login to Head Node
// If post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading

The Quickstart will deploy a Jumpbox EC2 Instance with HPC Management client libraries installed.
You can use this windows instance to perform all cluster administration and job management tasks remotely. 

< We need to put screenshots to show how to run HPC Node and jobs commands >

== Scale your Cluster
// If post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading

Manually scale your cluster by updating the autoscaling configuration

< We need put screenshots here either command to update ASG numbers or manually hunt for ASG and update >

= Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

== Selecting Compute

For Head Node,

For Compute Node,

== Selecting network

Using Single AZ and private subnet

Security Groups

== Selecting storage
For high performance parallel FileSystem,

For object storage, 

For Data Movement, leverage Data SYNC 

== Placement Groups

Take advantage of Cluster placement groups for tightly coupled HPC Workload.
HPC applications that exchanges a large amount of data between nodes can use Placement group to provide low latency and high throughput.

The quickStart uses **Cluster Placement group** strategy within the Amazon EC2 Launch template to group all the worker nodes into single Availability zone. 

* Why placement group ?

To learn more, visit the documentation below.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html

A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone.
A cluster placement group can span peered VPCs in the same Region. Instances in the same cluster
placement group enjoy a higher per-flow throughput limit for TCP/IP traffic and are placed in the 
same high-bisection bandwidth segment of the network.


== Optimize Compute Node AMI

The QuickStart is configured to pull latest Windows Server AMI provided by AWS.
When scale your cluster using autoscaling group,the user data script within launch template installs the Microsoft HPC Pack software and CloudWatch Agent during the boot.
This can significantly impact time to prepare the fleet of compute workers and introduce delay in submitting the job.

To further optimize, you could use Amazon EC2 Image Builder to fully baked the Compute Node AMI and update the launch template with AMI ID of custom image.

== Autoscaling Best practices
//_Add any best practices for using the software._

Autoscaling should be considered based on your requirement. There are scenarios where you can take advantage of autoscaling feature to drive efficiency.
Below are some example scenarios to explain how autoscaling can be used to drive efficiency.

* Scaling based on fixed capacity.


* Scaling based on queued tasks.

= Security
//_Add any security-related information._

. Certificates
. Security Groups for worker, head, rdp etc 
. Domain join vs non domain join worker



= Other useful information
//Provide any other information of interest to users, especially focusing on areas where AWS or cloud usage differs from on-premises usage.

_Add any other details that will help the customer use the software on AWS._
